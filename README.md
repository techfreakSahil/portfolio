ðŸ›  Customization
To customize the portfolio with your own details, follow these steps:

Open the src/utils/data.ts file.
Replace the existing data with your own details. This includes your name, skills, projects, and contact information.
For each project, you can specify the name, description, and a link to the project. You can also add a screenshot of the project by placing the image in the public/images/ directory and referencing it in the image field.
To add icons, you can use any icon library, such as FontAwesome or Material Icons. Simply import the icons and use them in your components.
To add a favicon, you can generate one using a tool like favicon.io. Once you have your favicon, place it in the public/ directory and reference it in the public/index.html file like so: <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />.
